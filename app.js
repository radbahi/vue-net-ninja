const app = Vue.createApp({
  //data and functions go here. vue will inject this template into the app div in app.js
  //   template: "<h2>I am the template</h2>",
  //but of course this can get messy quick so its best to put any html within the div we're mounting
});
//basic boilerplate for mounting an app with vue
app.mount("#app");
